# ArcGIS ready tools for nearest neighbor analysis in archaeology: Clark & Evans 1954 // Hopkins & Skellam 1954 test

This set of tools was used in PhD thesis [(Buławka, N., 2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345728606_Bulawka_Nazarij_2020_Osadnictwo_Kultury_Jaz_w_Oazach_Tedzenu_i_Murgabu_w_Turkmenistanie_The_Settlement_of_Yaz_Culture_in_the_Oases_of_Tedjen_and_Murghab_in_Turkmenistan_Rozprawa_Doktorska_Warsaw_Unive)  to be used directly in ArcGIS 10.3.1 version.

The tools uses [Spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/index.html) R library 

## Clark & Evans 1954 test 

## Hopkins & Skellam 1954 test 

According to the Hopkins-Skellam test of Complete Spatial Randomness the quotient of the sum of the distances between points and their nearest neighbors (I) and random points and their nearest neighbors (P) will be 1 if these points are also arranged in a random way. The measure that indicates the distribution of points is the index A, which can be expressed as follows:

It must then be calculated and compared to the value of x to the beta distribution with parameters (n, n). The value of x may be calculated by the formula:
